   - Enhances the deployment mechanism for machine guns in-game.
* **Parachute Provider** (`1.0.0`), Jonathan Linat (https://github.com/jonathanlinat)
   - Provides a parachute to players when they are falling from a height, allowing for a slow and safe descent. Players can activate the parachute by pressing the 'use' key while in mid-air. It contributes to a fun and dynamic gameplay experience in the server.
* **Player Healer** (`1.0.0`), Jonathan Linat (https://github.com/jonathanlinat)
